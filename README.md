🧠 How It Works

The game board is a 3x3 matrix (board) updated based on player mouse clicks.

X and O alternate turns.

Win conditions are checked for rows, columns, and both diagonals.

A winner message or "Draw" message is displayed when the game ends.

A "Play Again" button appears when the game is over, allowing the players to restart the game without closing the window.
